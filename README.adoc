= BASH Profile

toc::[]

== Summary
This is the collection of BASH profile scripts I use. No claim to fitness is made.

== Installation
Running the install script prompts before replacing any existing bash config files.

NOTE: I would like to _source_ the updated profile out of the installation script, but that does not seem possible. It
may be, but I have not dug deeply into it. The problem is that the script runs in it's own shell, which means the _source_
command does not apply to the shell from which install is run. Thus, be sure to execute the _source_ command.

. Clone the project
. Switch to directory into which project was cloned
. Grant permission to installation script `chmod +x install.sh`
. Run installation script `./install.sh`. This will:
.. Create directory `dot_files_backup` in the user home directory (`~`), if it does not exist.
.. For each dot file that differs from the corresponding file in the project:
... Append a timestamp to the file name
... Move the to the backup directory
... Copy the dot file from the project directory to the user home.
. Source bash_profile `source ~/.bash_profile`

== Files
=== *.bash_profile*
The one to rule them all.

=== *.bashrc*
=== *.profile*
=== *.bash_aliases*
A partial list of aliases. Use command `alias` to list all that are in effect.

==== Interactive operation...
|===
|Command| Notes
|cp     |cp -vi - to prompt when copying if you want to overwrite and will tell you where
|rd     |rm --interactive=once --recursive --dir --force --verbose' - Prompts you if you really want to remove it.
|mv     |mv -i - Prompts you if you are going to overwrite something
|===

=== *.bash_exports*

=== *.bash_functions*
|===
|Function | Notes
|copy-to-branch |allows copying of changes to a different branch, even if branch only exists on the remote (it fetches said branches)
|findpart |finds the partition name for a given filename
|git-ticket |parses the ticket name from the branch
|git-commit |uses git-ticket to prepend the commit message with the ticket name
|===

=== *.bash_logout*

=== *.bash_options*

=== *.bash_custom*
This is a stub so that settings can be overriden at each client site (or whatever). Note that the install will create
it but not overwrite it.

== Installation Issues
=== Globstar
==== Issue
Message `sh: shopt: globstar: invalid shell option name` appears when starting a new shell.

==== Explanation
The *globstar* option requires bash v4. This issue occured to me after installation on a Mac. See https://merikan.com/2019/04/upgrade-to-bash-5-in-macos/ for upgrading Mac to bash5.

==== Solution
. Run command `bash --version` to verify your version.
. Update your bash per your platform.
.. On Mac:
... Run homebrew command: `brew install bash`
... Update /etc/shells: `echo /usr/local/bin/bash | sudo tee -a /etc/shells`
... Link to terminal app: `ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash-terminal-app`
... Set Terminal to open terminal app: Terminal > Preferences > General tab > Shells open with: Command: `/usr/local/bin/bash-terminal-app`

=== Meld
==== Issue
Meld is missing.

==== NOTE
I use DeltaWalker, which integrates nicely with Git. Also, modern IDEs often have quality
git diff built-in, so I never use the git-diff alias and may remove it. This is still here
just in case I find myself in a situation where I don't have the opportunity to use the
toolsets of my choice.

An option, though I have not done so, is override the alias in the `.bash_custom` file. For more on
Deltawalker integration, see:

. https://www.deltawalker.com/preferences/general-scm-integration
. https://www.deltawalker.com/integrate/git-hg-bazaar-svn

==== Explanation
Script `.bash_aliases` sets diff to Meld.

==== Solution
. Change the diff alias to some other diff/merge tool. See https://www.tecmint.com/best-linux-file-diff-tools-comparison/ for options.
. Install Meld
.. On Linux, use a package manager.
.. On Windows, use the Meld installer available at: http://meldmerge.org/
.. On Mac, installation is not supported. You can attempt to install it using homebrew (see below). See http://meldmerge.org/ for other options.
... Run `brew tap homebrew/cask`
... Run `brew cask install meld`

== TODO
. Aliases _commit-freq_ and _commit-freq-log_ should be functions to make them more robust.
. There is no .bash_history file in this collection. It could potentially be usable. Perhaps a stubbed version could be created.
. Document further - maybe
. Fix installation script to source bash_profile
. Test all this against my Ubuntu machine. I am especially interested in changes to the ls commands referencing color.
. Are there other commands using _--color_ I have not checked?
. Diff references meld. Is that what I want? Add to prerequesites section.
