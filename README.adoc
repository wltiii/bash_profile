= BASH Profile

toc::[]

== Summary
This is the collection of BASH profile scripts I use. No claim to fitness is made.

== Installation
Running the install script prompts before replacing any existing bash config files. 

NOTE: as of writing this, the script does not properly execute the source command, therefore you must run it manually.

. Clone the project
. Switch to directory into which project was cloned
. Grant permission to installation script `chmod +x install.sh`
. Run installation script `./install.sh`
. Source bash_profile `source ~/.bash_profile`

== Files
=== *.bashrc*
=== *.bash_profile*
=== *.profile*
=== *.bash_aliases*
A partial list of aliases. Use command `alias` to list all that are in effect.

== Installation Issues
=== Globstar
==== Issue
Message `sh: shopt: globstar: invalid shell option name` appears when starting a new shell.

==== Explanation
The *globstar* option requires bash v4. This issue occured to me after installation on a Mac.

==== Solution
. Run command `bash --version` to verify your version.
. Update your bash per your platform.
.. On Mac:
... Run homebrew command: `brew install bash`
... Update /etc/shells: `echo /usr/local/bin/bash | sudo tee -a /etc/shells`
... Link to terminal app: `ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash-terminal-app`
... Set Terminal to open terminal app: Terminal > Preferences > General tab > Shells open with: Command: `/usr/local/bin/bash-terminal-app`

== TODO
. There is no .bash_history file in this collection. It could potentially be usable. Perhaps a stubbed version could be created.
. Document further - maybe
. Fix installation script to source bash_profile
. Test all this against my Ubuntu machine. I am especially interested in changes to the ls commands referencing color.
. Are there other ls "color" commands I have not checked?
