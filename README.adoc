toc::[]

== Summary
This is the collection of BASH profile scripts I use. No claim to fitness is made.

== Files
. *.bashrc*
. *.bash_profile*
. *.profile*
. *.bash_aliases*
. *.bash_exports*
. *.bash_functions*
. *.bash_logout*
. *.bash_options*

== TODO
There is no .bash_history file in this collection. It could potentially be usable. Perhaps a stubbed version could be created.
